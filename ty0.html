    <h1></h1>
    <p1><strong>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br> <br>Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br><br</strong>
        <br>It is our light, not our darkness that frightens us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Your playing small does not serve the world.</em> 
        <br>
        <br>
        There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are all meant to shine, as children do. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
        <br>
        It is not just in some of us; <br><br>it is in everyone, <br><br>and as we let our own light shine, <br>we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
        As we are liberated from our own fear, <br><br>our presence automatically liberates others.<br><br>
